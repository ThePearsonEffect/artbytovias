This is a placeholder for the Lanky Bois logo image file. 

To complete the setup, you'll need to save an actual PNG image file here with the Lanky Bois logo.

The logo should be:
- A PNG file with transparent background
- Approximately 200-300px wide
- Black text/design (since we've set up a white background)
- Should include "Lanky Bois" branding

The current code is expecting this file at /images/lankybois/lanky-bois-logo.png and will display it with a white background for proper visibility.

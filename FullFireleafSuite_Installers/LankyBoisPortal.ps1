  <h1>👕 Lanky Bois: Shirt Off My Back (SOMB)</h1>
  <p><strong>Lanky Bois</strong> is more than fashion — it’s faith, street culture, and heart stitched into fabric.</p>
  <p><strong>SOMB</strong> stands for “Shirt Off My Back.” Every shirt tells a story and becomes a seed: 
     either given to someone in need or sold to build legacy and ownership.</p>
  <p>This project merges entrepreneurship, purpose, and design to form a self-sustaining movement for good.</p>
  <p>✨ *Created from the brains of writers, the souls of lovers, and deeply rooted in faith.*</p>
